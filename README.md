# FlashCards Project

Module 2 Solo Project at the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/)

By: Kara Caputo

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a program to simulate a flashcards quiz game to be played through the command line. A user is able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

* [Project Brief and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/flash-cards.html)

## Programming Languages Use

* Javascript

## Project Goals

Complete four iterations to build the flashcard game which included: 
* Complete an object-oriented application
* Writing modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD (Test Driven Design)
* Utilizing `eslint` to ensure code consistency
* Project planning

## Functionality

* Upon invoking the program in terminal, a welcome message is displayed, followed by a flashcard and three answer choices
* Enter answer number, then press 'enter'
* Program responds with a feedback statement indicating whether an answer is correct or incorrect
* At the end of the game, a final message is displayed which includes percentage of correct answers
